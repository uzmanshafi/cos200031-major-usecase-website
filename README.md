## Introduction
Archery Score Recorder was created for the <b><i>Swinburne COS20031</i></b> unit assignment and is a simple and efficient web application that allows archers to keep track of their scores in real-time. Developed in PHP and JavaScript, the application offers an easy-to-use interface that facilitates the input of scores with a virtual keypad, and dynamically adjusts the number of "ends" based on the user's preference.
